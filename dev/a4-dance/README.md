So You Think Ants Can Dance

## C Range Work

I followed the template provided within animated_charater.cc to set the current transformation matrix equal to the bone's parents space * transformation into bone's rotation axes space * joint rotation * back to bone space. I commented out the coordinate frame for work in the A range

## B Range Work

I trimmed both the front and the back of each frame by the same amount in order to get some motion but not the entire range of it. I used the given clips of: 05_10.amc, 05_09.amc, 05_20.amc, and 05_06.amc. They are labeled ballet_special_ (2 ... 5) . I initially used the quick shapes draw line segment routine to get straight line for a stick figure (a standard sphere for the head) that could have its bones rotated via the current transformation matrix, but I changed the thorax, lower back, upper back, and head geometry for the A range work. This may be a bug, but the ballet special dancer gets larger the more times you click on the motion keys. It wasn't specified in the rubric that this shouldn't happen so I let it be. I can adjust it if required.

## A Range Work

I copied the course's example ant figure for my own a -range work. I used spheres that were via transformation matrices for the thorax, lower back, upper back, and the base of the head. I used spheres that I flattened for the eyes and the mouth. For the antennas I used cones as in the example. I chose a dark red for the color of my ant but black for its features and limbs.
