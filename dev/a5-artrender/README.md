## C Range Work

Phong shading with the standard Blinn-Phong lighting model was implemented using:

v = position in eye space
l = vertex to the light
e = vertex to eye space
n = normal in eye space
h = half way vector 
ambient, diffuse and specular were calculated using the example in class

## B Range Work

toonDiffuse and toonSpecular were used as ramps for artsy
diff_intensity is used to calculate the diffuse intensity before calling texture()
half way vector is used here as well

## A Range Work

I didn't do anything special here, just followed the lectur example on detecting sillouhette edges.
